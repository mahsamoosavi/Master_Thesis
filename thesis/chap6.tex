\chapter{Concluding Remarks}

In this thesis, we took a deep look into the public key infrastructure and the traditional web certification model. A thorough empirical study of the CA ecosystem has been performed and the major issues were entirely discussed. We introduce a novel \UA PKI and naming system called \Ghazalstar on the Ethereum blockchain. We hope that \UA systems with programmability continue to be explored in the literature. There are many open problems to work on. First and foremost is understanding the scalability issues and how to minimize the amount of data a client browser needs to fetch for each domain lookup. Blockstack has done an excellent job on this issue for non-programmable contracts. Future work could also look at the layer above the smart contract: building web tools with user interfaces to enable interaction with the underlying functions. Finally, while auctions are one illustrative example of why programmability might be added to a PKI, we are sure there are many others. The modular design of \Ghazalstar using object-oriented programming should allow easy additions to our base contract, which we will provide as open source. Indeed, the auction itself in \Ghazalstar was added via inheritance and one function override (to enforce that ownership transfers, part of the parent class, could not be called during a live auction).
