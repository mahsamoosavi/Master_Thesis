{\bf Acknowledgments}
\end{center}

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to my supervisor, Dr. Jeremy Clark, without him I could not have completed my Master's degree. I am always indebted for his continuous support, encouragement, patience, friendship, and immense knowledge. He has taught me how to do research and guided me throughout my studies at Concordia University. Simply put, you are the best supervisor and advisor I could have ever asked for.

My special thanks to my office mates and colleagues for making my experience at Concordia University pleasant. I am especially thankful to Shayan Eskandari, for his support and help he has provided.

I would like to thank my parents and little brother for being loving and caring throughout my whole life. I left you behind to start a new journey in Canada and I simply miss you in every single moments of my life. I extremely appreciate your kindness, love, and support in all stages of my life.

Last but not least, I want to deeply thank a person who means a lot to me, my husband and my best friend, Kaveh, without whose love and support I just could not have been ``myself''. I cried with you, I laughed with you, and I grew up with you. Thank you for always being there for me and for believing in me all the time.
